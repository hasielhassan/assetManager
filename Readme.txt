This is a simple Asset Management tool which helps you to set your Show, episode, scene, shot appropriately.  If set correctly, the user can imput the shot number. 
The user input is connected throughout. Which will enable you to save your script in the appropriate location, save your write nodes in the right place with the proper naming convension. 


Setup:

- Copy all of this in your .nuke folder
- Modify the environment.py file to your project root directory
- Modify the manager.py file and name it according to your shows

Run nuke and you will see a popup. 


The manager.py file gives a clear indication as to how the naming convension of a show is supposed to look like. 

If in doubt - eat something and think :D
